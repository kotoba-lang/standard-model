  "Tests for the GTG (Lasenby-Doran-Gull 1998) rotation-gauge sector (Phase
  0a) and position-gauge sector (Phase 0b) -- see kotoba.sm.gtg's namespace
  docstring for the exact scope. The `trace-normalization-*` tests below are
  the load-bearing ones: they record, numerically, that kotoba.sm.gauge's
  (Phase-0a-era, compact-group-only) trace normalization
  Tr(T^aT^b)=1/2delta^ab does NOT hold for the noncompact so(1,3) bivector
  generators.

  `structure-constants-now-match-genuine-values-after-gauge-fix` (formerly
  `raw-structure-constants-diverge-from-genuine-ones`, see that deftest's own
  docstring for the before/after) records the CONSEQUENCE of that fact as it
  stood at Phase 0a time: `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants`'s raw output
  used to diverge from the genuine so(1,3) structure constants. That has
  SINCE BEEN FIXED by generalizing `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants` to
  compute its own generator set's trace-Gram matrix instead of assuming it is
  1/2delta^AB -- so raw and genuine now MATCH. These numbers are recorded
  honestly either way, not massaged to force agreement.

  `flat-limit-h-reproduces-minkowski-metric-exactly` and
  `global-lorentz-transformations-are-the-constant-flat-special-case`
  (Phase 0b, position-gauge sector) are the load-bearing tests for the
  position gauge field h_mu and its derived metric g_mu-nu -- see

  "BEFORE/AFTER: this deftest used to be named
  `rotation-field-strength-self-interaction-not-antisymmetric-for-mixed-trace-gram-sign-components`
  and asserted the OPPOSITE of what it asserts now -- it recorded an HONEST SCOPE-GAP: for a
  self-interaction term exciting one boost-type and one rotation-type Omega component,
  R[0][1][1] and R[1][0][1] came out numerically EQUAL (+0.35 and +0.35) instead of negatives of
  each other, breaking the physically required R_mu-nu = -R_nu-mu antisymmetry.

  ROOT CAUSE (now fixed): `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term` read the structure-constant
  array as f-abc[a][b][cc] (output/free index `a` in the FIRST slot), but `structure-constants`
  itself defines f[A][B][D] from [T_A,T_B]=if^{ABD}T_D, where D -- the output/target index -- is
  the THIRD slot. For su(2)/su(3) (uniform Tr(T^aT^b)=1/2delta^ab Gram, so f^ABC is totally
  antisymmetric under ANY index permutation) this slot mismatch is numerically invisible -- see
  gauge_test.cljc's `self-interaction-term-slot-order-fix-is-bit-identical-for-su2-and-su3`. But
  f[A][B][D] = -i Tr([T_A,T_B]T_D)/K[D][D] is only antisymmetric under swapping its FIRST TWO
  indices (inherited from the commutator); moving the THIRD index elsewhere additionally divides
  by a DIFFERENT K[D][D] when K is diagonal but non-uniform, as it is here (K=+1 rotation-type,
  K=-1 boost-type -- `compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?`). Reading `a` out of the wrong
  slot therefore silently broke antisymmetry whenever the two summed-over Omega components mixed
  a boost-type and a rotation-type index. `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term` has SINCE BEEN
  FIXED to read f-abc[b][cc][a] (output index in the THIRD/target slot, matching
  `structure-constants`'s own convention) -- see that function's docstring -- so R is now
  antisymmetric here too, same as the already-passing same-trace-gram-sign case above."

            (picking out f[3][0][a]); f[3][0][a]=-f[0][3][a] by antisymmetry under swapping the

;;   instead uses FINITE DIFFERENCES at BOTH derivative levels (this
;;   codebase has no symbolic-differentiation layer -- see kotoba.sm.gtg's
;;   PHASE 1 header comment for exactly which two levels and why), so its
;;   own achievable precision is looser: empirically ~1e-9..1e-10 at the

;;   nested-finite-difference algorithm in the Python reference before this
;;   Clojure port was written, then confirmed again on the actual Clojure
;;   output below) -- `close-fd?`'s eps=1e-7 gives ~2-3 orders of magnitude
