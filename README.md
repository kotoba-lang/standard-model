Classical Standard Model field algebra in zero-dep, portable `.cljc`: **gauge
fields**, **tensor fields**, **vector fields**, and **spinor fields**, and the
equations of motion that relate them. See
[`90-docs/adr/2607051500-kotoba-lang-standard-model-field-theory-library.md`](../../../90-docs/adr/2607051500-kotoba-lang-standard-model-field-theory-library.md)
in the superproject for the full design rationale and scope boundary.

**Scope: classical field content, evaluated numerically.** This is *not* a
quantum field theory engine -- no path-integral quantization, no
renormalization/running couplings, no scattering amplitudes/cross-sections, no
lattice simulation. Those are legitimate, much larger follow-up efforts and are
out of scope here.

  (as opposed to purely kinematic machinery), scoped to the vacuum/source-free,
  spin-free closed-form solution only -- not a general-purpose gravity engine.

## Gauge Theory Gravity scope (`kotoba.sm.gtg`, Phase 0a + Phase 0b + Phase 0c + Phase 0d + Phase 0e + Phase 1)

Lasenby-Doran-Gull's 1998 observation is that the restricted Lorentz group
`SO(1,3)+` can be gauged with the exact same machinery `kotoba.sm.gauge`
already implements generically for the internal `U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3)` gauge
groups: the six bivector generators `T^{ab} = (i/4)[gamma^a,gamma^b]` of
`so(1,3)`, built from `kotoba.sm.spinor`'s Dirac gamma matrices, plug
straight into `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s generic structure-constant /
covariant-derivative / field-strength functions and reproduce the
rotation-gauge curvature `R_mu-nu` as an instance of that same generic
machinery -- no separate Yang-Mills-for-gravity implementation was written.

**Implemented (established literature content ported to this codebase, plus
new code that exercises it):**

1. the six `so(1,3)` bivector generators `T^{ab}`, a<b, as 4x4 complex
   matrices, reusing `kotoba.sm.spinor`'s existing gamma matrices and
   `sigma-munu`, and `kotoba.sm.complex`'s matrix algebra.
2. a numeric check that these generators close the Lorentz Lie algebra
   `[T^{ab},T^{cd}] = i(eta^{bc}T^{ad} - eta^{ac}T^{bd} - eta^{bd}T^{ac} +
   eta^{ad}T^{bc})`.
3. an **honesty check, not an assumption**: whether `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s
   (Phase-0a-era) compact-group trace normalization `Tr(T^aT^b)=1/2delta^ab`
   (documented there at the time as the basis for its `structure-constants`
   derivation, and verified in that namespace's tests only for the compact
   `SU(2)`/`SU(3)`) carries over to these noncompact `so(1,3)` generators. **It
   did not.** Numerically (`kotoba.sm.gtg/generator-trace-gram`,
   `kotoba.sm.gtg/compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?`, and
   `gtg_test.cljc`): the Gram matrix `Tr(T_A T_B)` is diagonal (same structure
   as the compact case) but its diagonal entries are **+/-1, not a uniform
   +1/2** -- exactly -1 for the 3 boost-type generators and +1 for the 3
   rotation-type generators, i.e. the indefinite Minkowski signature leaks
   directly into the generators' own trace pairing. Applying
   `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants` (Phase-0a version) to this generator
   set unmodified therefore did **not** give the genuine `so(1,3)` structure
   constants: the raw output was off by a factor `2*Tr(T_C T_C)` from the true
   value, i.e. **the wrong magnitude (2x) for every triple, and additionally
   the wrong SIGN whenever the third generator was boost-type**. **This has
   since been fixed**: `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants` was generalized
   to compute its own generator set's trace-Gram matrix `K[A][B]=Tr(T_AT_B)`
   instead of assuming a uniform `1/2delta^AB` (identical output for
   `SU(2)`/`SU(3)`, since their Gram matrix genuinely is `1/2delta^AB` -- see
   `gauge_test.cljc`'s `structure-constants-matches-legacy-*` regression
   tests), so applying it to this `so(1,3)` generator set now gives the
   genuine structure constants, matching `kotoba.sm.gtg/true-structure-constants`
   (`gtg_test.cljc`'s `structure-constants-now-match-genuine-values-after-gauge-fix`).
   A further, related noncompactness symptom recorded in the same test file
   (unaffected by the above fix): the 3 boost-type generators are
   anti-Hermitian (not Hermitian), while the 3 rotation-type generators are
   Hermitian -- the textbook reason (Peskin & Schroeder section 3.2) the Dirac
   spinor representation of the Lorentz group is not unitary. The
   `generator-trace-gram`/`true-structure-constants`/
   `compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?` functions are kept as an
   independent derivation and a live record of why the compact-group
   assumption fails here, even though `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants`
   no longer needs a workaround.
4. the rotation gauge field `Omega_mu` (a 6-component real bivector-valued
   gauge potential, in the same data shape `kotoba.sm.gauge` already uses)
   and its field strength / curvature bivector `R_mu-nu`, via
   `kotoba.sm.gauge/field-strength` applied to this generator set unmodified.
   The pure curl term `d_mu Omega_nu - d_nu Omega_mu` carries no
   normalization caveat (it does not involve structure constants at all); the
   self-interaction term uses the now-fixed `structure-constants` from point 3.
   A second, independent bug was later found (and fixed) in
   `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term` itself: it indexed the
   structure-constant array with the output/free generator index in the
   wrong array slot -- numerically invisible for the compact `U(1)`/`SU(2)`/
   `SU(3)` groups (whose structure constants are totally antisymmetric under
   any index permutation), but it broke the physically required
   `R_mu-nu = -R_nu-mu` antisymmetry for this `so(1,3)` generator set
   whenever the self-interaction term's two excited `Omega` components
   mixed a boost-type and a rotation-type index (this generator set's
   trace-Gram matrix is diagonal but **not** uniform, +1 for rotation-type
   vs -1 for boost-type -- see point 3). **This has since been fixed**
   (`kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term`'s docstring has the derivation);
   `R_mu-nu` is now antisymmetric for every excitation pattern, including
   mixed boost/rotation ones -- see `gtg_test.cljc`'s
   `rotation-field-strength-self-interaction-now-antisymmetric-*` tests for
   the before/after numeric record.
5. the spin-connection covariant derivative on a Dirac spinor,
   `D_mu psi = d_mu psi - i g Omega_mu^k T_k psi`, via
   `kotoba.sm.gauge/covariant-derivative` applied to this generator set
   unmodified.
6. a flat-limit check: with `Omega_mu = 0` everywhere, the covariant Dirac
   residual built on (5) is exactly `kotoba.sm.spinor`'s existing free
   Dirac-equation residual, verified numerically identical (not merely
   close), not just structurally argued.

**Phase 0b (position-gauge sector) adds:**

7. the position gauge field `h_mu(x)`: at each spacetime point, an
   invertible linear map from gauge coordinates to physical spacetime,
   represented as a 4x4 real matrix `h[mu][nu]` = `h_mu^nu` (row `mu` IS the
   physical four-vector `h_mu`, in the same `[t x y z]` component convention
   `kotoba.sm.tensor`/`kotoba.sm.vector-field` use everywhere else).
   `kotoba.sm.gtg/position-gauge-identity` is the trivial choice
   `h_mu^nu = delta_mu^nu` ("gauge coordinates = physical coordinates"). As
   with `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s own documented omission of a general matrix
   inverse, this namespace does not implement a determinant/invertibility
   check for `h` -- invertibility is a precondition on `h`, not something
   computed here.
8. the derived metric `g_mu-nu(x) = h_mu(x) . h_nu(x) = eta_ab h_mu^a(x)
   h_nu^b(x)` (`kotoba.sm.gtg/derived-metric`, `derived-metric-field`),
   computed by treating each row of `h` as an upper-index four-vector and
   reusing `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot` (the existing Minkowski inner product) row
   by row -- no new inner-product machinery. **Verified EXACTLY** (bit-for-bit
   integer arithmetic, not merely close within a tolerance) to reduce to
   `kotoba.sm.tensor/metric` at `h = position-gauge-identity`
   (`gtg_test.cljc`'s `flat-limit-h-reproduces-minkowski-metric-exactly`).
9. a consistency check that `kotoba.sm.vector-field`'s pre-existing global
   `SO(3,1)+` representation (`boost`/`rotation-x`/`rotation-y`/`rotation-z`)
   is contained in this sector as the special case "`h_mu` = a constant
   Lorentz matrix, `Omega_mu = 0`": a constant `h` built from any Lorentz
   transformation reproduces the flat metric exactly (up to floating-point
   roundoff from `sqrt`/`cos`/`sin`), because `Lambda^T eta Lambda = eta`
   (`vector-field/lorentz?`'s defining property) algebraically implies
   `Lambda eta Lambda^T = eta`, which is exactly what `derived-metric`
   computes row-by-row for `h = Lambda` (derivation in `gtg.cljc`'s Phase-0b
   section-7 header comment; numeric check in `gtg_test.cljc`'s
   `global-lorentz-transformations-are-the-constant-flat-special-case`, for
   several concrete boosts and rotations).

**Phase 0c (curvature quadratic invariant, deliberately narrow) adds:**

10. `kotoba.sm.gtg/curvature-quadratic-invariant`: a scalar built from the
    rotation-gauge curvature bivector `R_mu-nu` **alone**, by lowering both
    spacetime indices with `kotoba.sm.tensor/lower2` and fully contracting
    with `kotoba.sm.tensor/full-contract` (reusing `kotoba.sm.tensor`'s
    **existing** rank-2 raise/lower/contract machinery -- no new tensor
    primitives added), per bivector-generator component `k`, summed over the
    6 components weighted by this namespace's own diagonal Killing-form-like
    trace pairing `generator-trace-gram` (point 3 above):
    `I = sum_k K[k][k] * (R_mu-nu^k R^{mu-nu}_k)` -- the
    `eta^mu-rho eta^nu-sigma R_mu-nu . R_rho-sigma` quadratic contraction, the
    so(1,3) analogue of `F_mu-nu^a F^mu-nu_a`.
    **This is honestly NOT the Lasenby-Doran-Gull curvature scalar
    `R = h^mu ^ h^nu . R(h-bar_nu, h-bar_mu)`.** That definition needs the
    position gauge field's *reciprocal frame* `h-bar`, i.e. a general 4x4
    matrix inverse -- not implemented anywhere in this codebase, and general-`h`
    curvature is explicitly out of scope (see below). The one case where
    `h-bar` is trivial (`h-bar = h` = the identity, no inverse needed) is
    `h = position-gauge-identity`, so this function is only *interpretable* in
    that special case, and it does not take an `h` argument at all (`R_mu-nu`
    is computed independently of `h`, see the still-deferred "full combined
    covariant derivative" note below). **Even at
    `h = position-gauge-identity`**, working through the true definition shows
    it is a **single LINEAR** contraction of `R_mu-nu` against the fixed
    bivector `h^mu^h^nu` -- the same relationship the (linear) Ricci scalar
    has to the full Riemann tensor -- while `curvature-quadratic-invariant`
    computes a **QUADRATIC** (`R` contracted against itself) invariant
    instead, the same relationship the Kretschmann scalar `R_abcd R^abcd` has
    to the Riemann tensor in ordinary GR. **Ricci scalar and Kretschmann
    scalar are different invariants of different degree in the curvature**:
    related only in that both vanish exactly when the full curvature vanishes
    (`gtg_test.cljc`'s `curvature-quadratic-invariant-vanishes-in-the-flat-limit`),
    not proportional to each other and not interchangeable in general -- so
    this function's output must not be read as "the GTG curvature scalar" or
    used as a stand-in for it. The true linear LDG contraction is deliberately
    **not** implemented either: pinning down which spacetime index pairs with
    which bivector-value index needs an LDG-convention detail this pass has no
    independent literature value to test against, so it is left as a named
    follow-up rather than guessed at. `curvature-quadratic-invariant` is also
    **not guaranteed non-negative** (`generator-trace-gram`'s `K` is
    indefinite, `+1`/`-1` -- a boost-dominated curvature can make it negative,
    another noncompactness symptom). Verified: exactly `0.0` in the flat limit
    (`Omega_mu = 0` everywhere), and a hand-checked nonzero value (`10.0`) for
    a concrete curvature bivector with a single rotation-type component,
    matching a by-hand `tensor/lower2` + `tensor/full-contract` computation
    (`gtg_test.cljc`'s `curvature-quadratic-invariant-nonzero-for-concrete-curvature`).

**Phase 0d (general-position-gauge reciprocal frame, a deliberately
two-staged addition) adds:**

11. **Stage 1 (implemented): a general `NxN` matrix inverse and a reciprocal
    (dual) frame for a general invertible `h`.** `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-det`,
    `mat-minor`, `mat-adjugate`, `mat-inverse` -- ordinary Laplace-expansion/
    adjugate linear algebra (textbook, no physics convention involved),
    throwing `ex-info` on a `~0` determinant rather than dividing by it, the
    same spirit as `kotoba.sm.gauge/diagonal-gram-real`'s guard on a `~0`
    Gram-matrix diagonal entry -- and `kotoba.sm.gtg/reciprocal-frame`: the
    reciprocal (dual) frame `h-bar^mu` of a GENERAL invertible
    position-gauge-field VALUE `h` (not just `position-gauge-identity` or a
    constant Lorentz matrix, Phase 0b's scope), defined by the standard
    linear-algebra dual-basis biorthogonality relation
    `h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu`, where `.` is the PLAIN component
    (Kronecker) pairing, NOT `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`'s Minkowski-metric
    pairing. This gives `Hbar = (H^-1)^T` (`mat-inverse` then
    `mat-transpose`) -- verified: `h * h^-1 = h^-1 * h = I` for a concrete
    non-identity invertible `h`; the biorthogonality relation holds
    numerically for that same `h`; a singular (`~0` determinant) `h` throws
    `ex-info`; and at `h = position-gauge-identity`, `h-bar = h` EXACTLY
    (bit-for-bit -- the identity matrix is its own inverse and its own
    transpose).

12. **Stage 2 (investigated, deliberately NOT implemented): the true
    Lasenby-Doran-Gull curvature scalar `R`.** Per the task instructions
    for this phase, stage 2 was to be implemented ONLY if the exact
    index/convention of the LDG formula
    `R = h^mu ^ h^nu . R(h-bar_nu, h-bar_mu)` could be confirmed from at
    least two independent literature sources that agree. The investigation
    found two independent, mutually-corroborating PRIMARY sources (by the
    original author team) that DO agree on the Ricci scalar's high-level
    structure:
    - Lasenby, Doran & Gull, "Gravity, Gauge Theories and Geometric
      Algebra", Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (1998) 356 487-582, updated
      version [arXiv:gr-qc/0405033](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0405033),
      section 4 "The field equations", eqns 4.9, 4.11, 4.12.
    - Lewis, Doran & Lasenby, "Quadratic Lagrangians and Topology in Gauge
      Theory Gravity", [arXiv:gr-qc/9910039](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9910039),
      section 2, eqns 5, 6, 12, 14.

    Both sources give (translating into this namespace's notation)
    `R = sum_{a,b} gamma^a . (gamma^b . R(h_b ^ h_a))`, where `h_b = h(e_b)`
    is exactly Phase 0b's existing `h`, `gamma^a` is the reciprocal of the
    FIXED background orthonormal frame (trivial under the Minkowski metric,
    `kotoba.sm.tensor/raise` applied to the ordinary basis vectors -- **not**
    a reciprocal frame of `h`), and `R(x^y)` is the bilinear extension of
    Phase 0a's `rotation-field-strength` to an arbitrary bivector argument
    (rigorously justified from `R_mu-nu`'s own defining bilinearity in its
    two vector slots, needing no further literature confirmation). This is
    a genuine, useful finding on its own: it shows Stage 1's
    `reciprocal-frame` (a reciprocal frame *of* `h`) is **not** what this
    formula's outer contraction needs at all, correcting the phase's
    original working assumption. **However**, translating
    `gamma^b . R(h_b^h_a)` (a vector-dot-bivector Clifford-algebra
    contraction) into this codebase's six-generator-component
    `R[mu][nu][k]` array representation requires an ADDITIONAL, nontrivial
    step -- which spacetime/generator-index slot the contracting vector's
    index pairs with, and with what sign/factor -- that neither source
    spells out in a form directly transcribable to this array
    representation. A hand re-derivation via the standard GA identity
    `v.(a^b)=(v.a)b-(v.b)a` produced a candidate formula, but with
    unresolved factor-of-2/sign risk once expressed over the six generator
    components, and no independent worked numeric example was found to test
    a candidate implementation against. This is exactly the class of
    silent-index-bug risk `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term`'s
    since-fixed slot-order bug (see `rotation-field-strength`'s docstring)
    and `curvature-quadratic-invariant`'s own honesty note (point 10 above)
    already flag for this precise problem. Per the task's own instructions,
    **declining to implement here is the correct outcome, not a failure**:
    `curvature-scalar` remains unimplemented, and this writeup (plus the
    matching docstring on `kotoba.sm.gtg/reciprocal-frame`) records the
    investigation so a future pass does not have to repeat the literature
    search from scratch.

**Phase 0e (GA-native Minkowski-paired reciprocal frame, plus a bounded,
declined stage-2 curvature-scalar investigation) adds:**

13. **`kotoba.sm.gtg/reciprocal-frame-minkowski`: the GA-native reciprocal
    frame, using the Minkowski pairing instead of Stage 1's plain pairing.**
    Stage 1's `reciprocal-frame` (point 11 above) uses the plain
    component/Kronecker pairing; its own HONESTY NOTE already derives, but
    stops short of implementing, the alternative built from
    `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`'s Minkowski invariant pairing instead -- the
    pairing Geometric Algebra / GTG actually use for a scalar product.
    `reciprocal-frame-minkowski` implements and independently re-verifies
    exactly that: `Hbar_eta = (H^-1)^T . eta` (re-derived from the
    biorthogonality condition `sum_a eta[a][a] Hbar[mu][a] H[nu][a] =
    delta[mu][nu]`, i.e. the matrix equation `Hbar . eta . H^T = I`).
    **Verified** (`gtg_test.cljc`): (a) the Minkowski-paired biorthogonality
    relation holds for a concrete non-identity invertible `h`, and the
    result differs numerically from `reciprocal-frame`'s plain-pairing
    output for the *same* `h` -- concretely, row 0 is `[0.5 0 0.5 0]`
    (Minkowski-paired) versus `[0.5 0 -0.5 0]` (plain-paired), agreeing on
    the timelike column and flipping sign on every spatial column exactly as
    predicted by `Hbar_eta = Hbar_flat . eta` (right-multiplying by the
    diagonal `eta` scales column `a` by `eta[a][a]`). (b) at
    `h = position-gauge-identity`, `h-bar_eta = eta` **exactly**
    (bit-for-bit): `h-bar^0 = h_0` but `h-bar^i = -h_i` for the 3 spatial
    rows -- genuinely different from `reciprocal-frame`'s `h-bar = h` at the
    same point, confirming the divergence `reciprocal-frame`'s HONESTY NOTE
    predicted without numerically checking it. (c) for a constant Lorentz
    transformation `h = Lambda` (`kotoba.sm.vector-field`'s existing
    boost/rotation matrices), `h-bar_eta = eta . Lambda` **exactly** (up to
    floating-point roundoff) -- a closed form derived from `vf/lorentz?`'s
    defining property `Lambda^T eta Lambda = eta`, checked for several
    concrete boosts/rotations.

14. **A bounded, declined attempt at independently verifying the true LDG
    curvature scalar `R` via linearized weak-field General Relativity
    (per this phase's task instructions: independent numerical
    verification, *not* a further literature read).** Plan: (i) pick a small
    metric perturbation `h_mu-nu(x)` with the known linearized-GR Ricci
    scalar `R^(1) = d^mu d^nu h_mu-nu - []h` (a standard textbook result);
    (ii) build a position-gauge field `h_mu(x) = delta_mu^nu +
    (1/2)h_mu^nu(x)` reproducing it via `derived-metric` to linear order
    (worked out and confirmed straightforward: `derived-metric` of that `h`
    equals `eta_mu-nu + h_mu-nu(x) + O(h^2)` exactly as expected, no new
    machinery needed); (iii) obtain the *corresponding* rotation-gauge field
    `Omega_mu(x)` from `h_mu(x)`'s derivatives; (iv) run
    `rotation-field-strength`; (v) test a candidate `R[mu][nu][k]->scalar`
    formula against `R^(1)`. **This attempt stopped at step (iii).** This
    codebase has no `h_mu(x) -> Omega_mu(x)` correspondence anywhere
    (grep-confirmed), and unlike the ordinary general-relativity
    vierbein-postulate torsion-free spin connection (which relates a
    curved-spacetime tetrad `e^a_mu` -- one flat index, one curved-coordinate
    index -- to Christoffel symbols), GTG's `h_mu^nu` has *both* indices as
    components of the *same* flat background vector space: `h` maps a flat
    gauge-coordinate direction to a flat physical-spacetime direction, with
    no curved-coordinate side to import the ordinary tetrad-postulate
    formula onto. The genuine GTG-specific "intrinsic" Omega-from-h relation
    (part of LDG's own gauge-invariance/field-equation construction) is
    exactly the kind of GTG-paper-specific, index/sign-convention-bearing
    formula this pass was told not to re-derive from the literature this
    round, and it cannot be safely reconstructed from generic (non-GTG)
    general-relativity textbook knowledge -- ordinary tetrad calculus does
    not carry over to GTG's flat, non-curved-coordinate formalism without
    exactly the kind of paper-specific translation step this codebase's own
    established practice already treats as too risky to guess at without an
    independent reference value (same class of risk as point 12's blocker,
    `rotation-field-strength`'s and `curvature-quadratic-invariant`'s
    docstrings). So this investigation stopped at the *same class* of
    blocker Phase 0d stage 2 hit -- an unverifiable index/sign convention,
    no independent numeric reference value -- one step *earlier* in the
    pipeline (`h -> Omega`, rather than `R -> scalar`). **Per the task's own
    instructions, declining to implement here is the correct outcome, not a
    failure**: `curvature-scalar` remains unimplemented (AS OF Phase 0e --
    Phase 1, point 15 below, resolves exactly this blocker).

**Phase 1 (the vacuum/spin-free field equation `Omega(h)`, the covariant
Riemann map, and the true LDG Ricci scalar -- ADR-2607102300) adds:**

15. **`kotoba.sm.gtg/omega-from-h`: the first FIELD EQUATION this namespace
    implements.** Everything through Phase 0e built KINEMATIC machinery
    (gauge potentials, curvature-as-a-functional-of-a-supplied-connection,
    reciprocal frames) without ever deriving `Omega_mu` from `h_mu` --
    `omega-from-h` is LDG's own closed-form VACUUM, SPIN-FREE solution of
    the rotation-gauge field equation, eq (4.53):
    `omega(a) = -H(a) + (1/2) a.(d_b^H(b))`, with `H(a) = hbar(grad ^
    hbar^-1(a))` (eq 4.49) and `hbar = kotoba.sm.gtg/frame-adjoint` of `h`
    (eq 2.46's adjoint relation, the SAME one Phase 0d/0e's reciprocal-frame
    derivations already use, applied here to the field `h` itself). Takes an
    `h`-FIELD (`x -> 4x4 matrix`, the SAME shape `derived-metric-field`'s
    `h-field` argument already uses) and a spacetime point, returns
    `Omega_mu(x)` in the SAME 4x6 shape `rotation-field-strength` already
    consumes. The formula was derived from LDG eqs (4.42)/(4.46)/(4.48)/
    (4.49)/(4.53) and independently cross-derived via a standalone Python/
    numpy+sympy verification script (not part of this repo) that reproduces
    LDG's own closed-form Schwarzschild solution (eq 6.73) to ~1e-13
    *before* any of this namespace's Clojure code was written. The minimal
    new GA-flavored primitives this required -- `frame-adjoint`,
    `bivector->matrix`/`matrix->bivector`, `wedge-vectors`,
    `vector-dot-bivector`, `bivector-commutator`, `H-field` -- are NOT a
    from-scratch geometric-algebra engine (each is independently numerically
    cross-checked against the Python reference before being trusted; see
    `kotoba.sm.gtg`'s PHASE 1 section header comment and each function's own
    docstring).
16. **`kotoba.sm.gtg/riemann-basis-pair`/`riemann-map-matrix`/`riemann-map`:
    the COVARIANT Riemann map, LDG eq (4.48)**:
    `R(a^b) = L_a omega(b) - L_b omega(a) + omega(a)xomega(b) - omega(c(a,b))`,
    `c(a,b) = a.omega(b) - b.omega(a)` (eq 4.46), `L_a = a.hbar(grad) =
    h(a).grad` (eq 4.42) -- **deliberately NOT** Phase 0a's flat `d_mu`:
    `L_a` differentiates along the position-dependent vector field `h(a)(x)`,
    a genuinely different connection than `rotation-gauge-field-gradient`'s
    fixed-coordinate-axis derivative. Reusing Phase 0a's flat-`d_mu`-based
    machinery here was independently tried and diagnosed as producing an
    IDENTICALLY ZERO (teleparallel/pure-gauge) curvature for *any* `h` -- a
    structurally wrong equation, not a sign slip (documented in the
    standalone verification script this phase's formulas were cross-checked
    against). `riemann-map`/`riemann-map-matrix` extend `R` to a genuine
    LINEAR map on the full 6-dimensional bivector space (a linear map is
    determined by its action on a basis, and `{e_mu^e_nu}` spans the
    bivector space), so `riemann-map` accepts *any* bivector argument --
    including one built from position-dependent vectors via `wedge-vectors`
    (needed by point 17), not only a fixed-frame basis pair.
17. **`kotoba.sm.gtg/curvature-scalar`: the TRUE Lasenby-Doran-Gull Ricci
    SCALAR**, `R = sum_{a,b} gamma^a.(gamma^b.R(h_b^h_a))` -- the formula
    point 12 (Phase 0d stage 2) and point 14 (Phase 0e) each confirmed the
    STRUCTURE of (two independent primary literature sources agreeing) but
    declined to implement, because translating `gamma^b.R(h_b^h_a)` into
    this codebase's array representation needed a bilinear extension of `R`
    to GENERAL (non-basis-pair) bivectors that did not exist yet. Point 16's
    `riemann-map` supplies exactly that missing piece, closing the gap with
    no remaining index/sign ambiguity: `gamma^a` = `tensor/raise` of the
    FIXED background basis vector `e_a` (trivial under the metric -- both
    literature sources confirm this, NOT `reciprocal-frame`/
    `reciprocal-frame-minkowski`, a *different* construction point 12 already
    found does not belong here); `h_b = h-field(x)[b]`; `R(h_b^h_a)` =
    `riemann-map` applied to `wedge-vectors(h_b,h_a)`. **Verified**
    (`gtg_test.cljc`): `0.0`, within finite-difference tolerance, for LDG's
    own Schwarzschild vacuum solution at two independent test points/mass
    parameters -- the physically expected result (a vacuum solution has zero
    Ricci tensor, hence zero Ricci scalar as a direct special case) -- and
    *exactly* `0.0` (not merely close) at the flat limit. **Also verified**:
    `-4*Lambda`, within finite-difference tolerance, for LDG's own
    **pure-de-Sitter cosmological solution** (section 6.6 "Cosmology",
    Table 6/eq 6.169 at `rho=p=0`) at 3 independent (spatial point, `Lambda`)
    combinations, run through the *same* h-field -> `omega-from-h` ->
    `riemann-basis-pair` -> `curvature-scalar` pipeline end to end -- the
    first genuinely *nonzero* curvature-scalar value this pipeline has been
    checked against (Schwarzschild's `R=0` cannot by itself confirm a sign
    or magnitude; this closes exactly that gap, left open by an earlier
    docs-only investigation that confirmed the same sign convention only by
    hand-building eq (6.169)'s Riemann operator in isolation, not by running
    the real pipeline -- see `curvature-scalar`'s own ARGUMENT-ORDER
    docstring section). This is the first curvature-SCALAR result this
    namespace's whole Phase 0a-1 history reaches, arrived at only because
    point 16 removed the specific, previously-unverifiable index/sign step
    that blocked Phase 0c/0d/0e in turn -- not by relaxing this namespace's
    verification discipline.

    **Phase 1 scope note**: `omega-from-h`/`curvature-scalar` implement ONLY
    the VACUUM (source-free, `T_ab=0`), SPIN-FREE closed-form solution
    (eq 4.53) -- not the general field equation with a matter/torsion
    source, not the Einstein tensor/multivector, not the GTG action
    principle, and verified against exactly TWO known exact solutions:
    Schwarzschild (`R=0`) and pure de Sitter (`T_ab=0`, `Lambda!=0`,
    `R=-4*Lambda`) -- not a general equivalence-to-GR proof, and not a
    confirmation that this closed form extends to matter-sourced
    (`T_ab!=0`) cosmology: a nonzero-density (dust) extension was
    investigated and **declined** -- `omega-from-h` faithfully reproduces
    Table 6's own `omega(a)` for that case too, but the resulting
    `curvature-scalar` did not match the independently-verified trace
    identity, tracing to an unresolved vector.bivector contraction-order
    ambiguity in eq (6.169)'s `(rho+p)` term (identically zero, and
    therefore moot, for the pure-de-Sitter case landed here) -- reported
    honestly as a follow-up rather than risked as a silently-wrong test.

**Explicitly out of scope, not implemented here** (deliberately, deferred to
a later phase if ever pursued): the Einstein tensor/multivector `G(a)`, the
GTG action principle, the general (matter/torsion-sourced) field equation
(only the vacuum/spin-free closed form (4.53) is implemented, point 15
above), any proof of equivalence to General Relativity for *general* `h`
(point 17's `curvature-scalar` is verified against exactly two known exact
solutions, not a general equivalence proof), and any dark-matter/dark-energy
(nonzero-matter-density, `T_ab!=0`) cosmological extension -- a *pure*
vacuum-plus-cosmological-constant (`T_ab=0`, `Lambda!=0`, de Sitter) solution
**is** now covered (see point 17 above); a genuine matter-coupled extension
was investigated and declined, and remains out of scope. **Also out of
scope**: a general (non-vacuum) combined
`h_mu` + `Omega_mu` GTG covariant derivative with torsion -- Phase 0a's
covariant derivative (5) still stands independently of the vacuum connection
Phase 1 derives (it was built for a *supplied* `Omega_mu`, not the field-
equation solution); wiring Phase 1's `omega-from-h` into (5) to get a genuine
matter-coupled covariant Dirac equation in curved spacetime is a legitimate,
much larger follow-up, deliberately deferred to a later phase. **This
namespace implements the rotation-gauge sector's generator algebra/covariant
derivative, the position-gauge sector's derived metric, one narrowly-scoped
curvature quadratic invariant, two general-h dual-basis reciprocal frames
(plain-pairing and Minkowski-pairing), and the VACUUM/SPIN-FREE field
equation with its covariant Riemann map and Ricci scalar only** -- it should
not be described as "GTG fully implemented" or as any kind of general-purpose
gravity engine.
