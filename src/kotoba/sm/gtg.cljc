  "Gauge Theory Gravity (Lasenby-Doran-Gull 1998, 'Gravity, gauge theories and
  geometric algebra') -- ROTATION-GAUGE SECTOR (Phase 0a), POSITION-GAUGE
  SECTOR (Phase 0b), A NARROWLY-SCOPED CURVATURE QUADRATIC INVARIANT
  (Phase 0c, h = position-gauge-identity ONLY -- NOT the LDG curvature
  scalar), A GENERAL-h RECIPROCAL FRAME (Phase 0d), A GA-NATIVE
  MINKOWSKI-PAIRED RECIPROCAL FRAME (Phase 0e), AND -- NEW IN THIS PHASE --
  THE VACUUM/SOURCE-FREE FIELD EQUATION Omega(h) (Phase 1) ONLY. See the
  'Scope' section of the repo README for the ADR reference.

  PHASE 1 (ADR-2607102300) is the first FIELD EQUATION implemented in this
  namespace -- everything before it (Phase 0a-0e) built the KINEMATIC
  machinery (gauge potentials, curvature-as-a-functional-of-a-connection,
  reciprocal frames) without ever deriving Omega_mu FROM h_mu; Phase 1 adds
  `omega-from-h` (LDG eq 4.53, the closed-form VACUUM/SPIN-FREE solution of
  the rotation-gauge field equation given a position-gauge field h), the
  covariant Riemann map `riemann-map`/`riemann-map-matrix` (eq 4.48), and
  (having independently verified the pipeline against LDG's own Schwarzschild
  solution to finite-difference precision, see gtg_test.cljc) the true LDG
  Ricci SCALAR `curvature-scalar` that Phase 0c/0d/0e each investigated and
  each declined to implement. See this namespace's 'PHASE 1' section below
  for the full derivation and gtg_test.cljc for the Schwarzschild-solution
  regression tests this phase is built and checked against. Phase 1 is
  DELIBERATELY SCOPED to the VACUUM, SPIN-FREE field equation ONLY -- see
  the PHASE 1 section's own scope note for exactly what remains out of
  scope (matter/source coupling, the full field equation with torsion, the
  Einstein tensor, the action principle, and any de Sitter/cosmological-
  constant/dark-matter extension).

  GTG's central observation (well known in the literature, not a new result
  of this namespace) is that the restricted Lorentz group SO(1,3)+ can be
  gauged exactly like the internal Yang-Mills groups already implemented in
  `kotoba.sm.gauge`: the six bivector generators T^{ab} of so(1,3), built
  from `kotoba.sm.spinor`'s existing Dirac gamma matrices, plug directly into
  `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s *generic* (not hard-coded to U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3))
  structure-constant / covariant-derivative / field-strength functions and
  reproduce the rotation-gauge-field curvature R_mu-nu -- the GTG analogue of
  the Yang-Mills field strength -- as a direct instance of that same generic
  machinery.

  SCOPE -- this namespace implements ONLY:
    1. the six so(1,3) bivector generators T^{ab} = (i/4)[gamma^a,gamma^b],
       a<b, as 4x4 complex matrices (`generators`, `generator`).
    2. a numeric check (in gtg_test.cljc) that these six generators close the
       Lorentz Lie algebra: [T^{ab},T^{cd}] = i(eta^{bc}T^{ad} - eta^{ac}T^{bd}
       - eta^{bd}T^{ac} + eta^{ad}T^{bc}) (`lorentz-algebra-rhs`).
    3. an HONEST numeric check of whether `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s (as of Phase 0a)
       compact-group trace normalization Tr(T^aT^b) = 1/2 delta^ab carries
       over to this noncompact generator set. IT DID NOT -- see
       `generator-trace-gram`, `true-structure-constants`,
       `compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?` and gtg_test.cljc for the
       actual numbers and the failure mode this Phase 0a check exposed in
       `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants`'s output (a factor of 2*K[C][C]
       off, wrong SIGN for boost-type indices). THIS HAS SINCE BEEN FIXED:
       `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants` was generalized (post-Phase-0a)
       to compute its own generator set's trace-Gram matrix K[A][B]=Tr(T_AT_B)
       instead of assuming it is 1/2delta^AB, so it is no longer restricted to
       the compact-group normalization and its output for this so(1,3)
       generator set is now the GENUINE structure constants -- see
       `rotation-raw-structure-constants` and gtg_test.cljc's
       `structure-constants-now-match-genuine-values-after-gauge-fix` (the
       renamed/inverted former `raw-structure-constants-diverge-from-genuine-ones`).
       This section's functions (`generator-trace-gram`, `true-structure-constants`,
       `compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?`, `basis-projection`) are KEPT as
       an independent derivation of the genuine structure constants and a live,
       re-checkable record of WHY Tr(T^aT^b)=1/2delta^ab fails to hold for a
       noncompact generator set -- useful documentation and cross-check value
       even though `kotoba.sm.gauge/structure-constants` no longer needs the
       workaround.
       A related, independently-checked noncompactness symptom (gtg_test.cljc,
       'generators-are-4x4-complex-matrices'): the 3 boost-type generators
       T^{0i} are ANTI-Hermitian, not Hermitian, while the 3 rotation-type
       generators T^{ij} are Hermitian -- the textbook reason (Peskin &
       Schroeder section 3.2, whose S^{mu-nu}=(i/4)[gamma^mu,gamma^nu] is
       literally this namespace's T^{ab}) the Dirac spinor representation of
       the Lorentz group is not unitary.
    4. the rotation gauge field Omega_mu (a 6-component real bivector-valued
       gauge potential, same data shape `kotoba.sm.gauge` already uses for
       A_mu^a) and its field strength / curvature bivector R_mu-nu, obtained
       by handing this generator set to `kotoba.sm.gauge/field-strength`
       unmodified (`rotation-field-strength`). R_mu-nu^k = -R_nu-mu^k
       (the physically required antisymmetry) now holds for EVERY excited
       Omega component, including mixed boost/rotation self-interaction --
       `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term` had an independent,
       since-fixed structure-constant slot-order bug (invisible for compact
       U(1)/SU(2)/SU(3) groups, but visible here because this generator
       set's trace-Gram matrix is diagonal yet non-uniform) that used to
       break this antisymmetry for mixed boost/rotation excitations; see
       `rotation-field-strength`'s docstring and gtg_test.cljc's
       `rotation-field-strength-self-interaction-now-antisymmetric-*` tests
       for the before/after record.
    5. the spin-connection covariant derivative on a Dirac spinor,
       D_mu psi = d_mu psi - i g Omega_mu^{ab} T_{ab} psi, obtained by
       handing this generator set to `kotoba.sm.gauge/covariant-derivative`
       unmodified (`spinor-covariant-derivative`).
    6. a flat-limit check (in gtg_test.cljc) that with Omega_mu = 0
       everywhere, the covariant Dirac residual built on top of (5) is
       EXACTLY (not just approximately) `kotoba.sm.spinor`'s existing free
       Dirac-equation residual (`dirac-residual-with-rotation-gauge`).

  PHASE 0b (position-gauge sector) adds:
    7. the position gauge field h_mu(x): at each spacetime point, an
       invertible linear map from gauge coordinates to physical spacetime,
       represented as a 4x4 real matrix `h[mu][nu]` = h_mu^nu (row `mu` IS
       the physical four-vector h_mu, in the same [t x y z] component
       convention `kotoba.sm.tensor`/`kotoba.sm.vector-field` use everywhere
       else). `position-gauge-identity` is the trivial choice h_mu^nu =
       delta_mu^nu ('gauge coordinates = physical coordinates'). AT PHASE 0b
       TIME this namespace did not implement a general matrix inverse to
       check h's invertibility numerically or to build a reciprocal frame for
       general h (the same deliberate omission `kotoba.sm.gauge` documents
       for its own structure-constant derivation) -- invertibility was a
       precondition on `h`, not something computed. PHASE 0d (item 11 below)
       adds a general NxN matrix inverse (`kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-inverse`) and
       uses it to build a reciprocal frame `reciprocal-frame` for ANY
       invertible h, not just `position-gauge-identity` -- invertibility is
       now CHECKED (throws `ex-info` on a ~0 determinant) rather than merely
       assumed.
    8. the derived metric g_mu-nu(x) = h_mu(x) . h_nu(x) = eta_ab h_mu^a(x)
       h_nu^b(x) (`derived-metric`, `derived-metric-field`), computed by
       treating each row of `h` as an upper-index four-vector and reusing
       `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot` (the existing Minkowski inner product) row by
       row -- no new inner-product machinery. A flat-limit check (in
       gtg_test.cljc) that at h = `position-gauge-identity` this is EXACTLY
       (bit-for-bit, integer arithmetic throughout, not merely close)
       `kotoba.sm.tensor/metric`.
    9. a consistency check that `kotoba.sm.vector-field`'s PRE-EXISTING
       global SO(3,1)+ representation (`boost`/`rotation-x`/`rotation-y`/
       `rotation-z`) is CONTAINED in this sector as the special case
       'h_mu = a constant Lorentz matrix, Omega_mu = 0' -- a constant h built
       from any Lorentz transformation reproduces the flat metric exactly
       (up to floating-point roundoff from sqrt/cos/sin), because
       Lambda^T eta Lambda = eta (`vector-field/lorentz?`'s defining
       property) algebraically implies Lambda eta Lambda^T = eta, which is
       exactly what `derived-metric` computes row-by-row for h = Lambda --
       see the section-7 header comment below for the derivation, and
       gtg_test.cljc's
       `global-lorentz-transformations-are-the-constant-flat-special-case`
       for the numeric check (several concrete boosts and rotations).
       `derived-metric-matches-flat?` packages this equality check (used for
       both (8)'s exact identity case and (9)'s Lorentz-matrix case).

  PHASE 0c (curvature quadratic invariant, DELIBERATELY NARROW SCOPE) adds:
    10. `curvature-quadratic-invariant`: a scalar built from the rotation-gauge
       curvature bivector R_mu-nu ALONE (`rotation-field-strength`'s output),
       by lowering both spacetime indices with `kotoba.sm.tensor/lower2` and
       fully contracting with `kotoba.sm.tensor/full-contract` (reusing
       `kotoba.sm.tensor`'s EXISTING rank-2 raise/lower/contract machinery,
       no new tensor primitives), per bivector-generator component k, then
       summing the 6 components weighted by this namespace's own diagonal
       Killing-form-like trace pairing `generator-trace-gram` (section 3
       above) -- i.e. I = sum_k K[k][k] (R_mu-nu^k R^{mu-nu}_k), the
       'eta^mu-rho eta^nu-sigma R_mu-nu . R_rho-sigma' quadratic contraction
       collapsed via the diagonal metric.
       THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT the Lasenby-Doran-Gull curvature scalar
       R = h^mu ^ h^nu . R(h-bar_nu, h-bar_mu). That definition needs the
       position gauge field's RECIPROCAL FRAME h-bar, i.e. a general 4x4
       matrix inverse, which is not implemented ANYWHERE in this codebase
       (see item 7's note and `kotoba.sm.gauge`'s own analogous documented
       omission) -- computing R for a general h is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE
       and deferred (see below). The one case where h-bar IS trivial to get
       right is h = `position-gauge-identity` (h-bar = h = the identity), so
       `curvature-quadratic-invariant` is scoped to being INTERPRETABLE only
       in that special case; it does not take an `h` argument at all because
       R_mu-nu itself (Phase 0a) is computed independently of h (Phase 0b) --
       see the FULL COMBINED covariant derivative note below, still deferred.
       EVEN AT h = `position-gauge-identity`, `curvature-quadratic-invariant`
       is honestly NOT a port of the LDG R: working through the definition,
       R = h^mu ^ h^nu . R(h-bar_nu, h-bar_mu) is a single LINEAR contraction
       of R_mu-nu (dot the FIXED bivector h^mu^h^nu, which does not depend on
       R at all, against R -- bilinear in two DIFFERENT bivectors, one of
       which is a constant), the same relationship the ordinary linear Ricci
       scalar R has to the full Riemann tensor. `curvature-quadratic-invariant`
       is instead QUADRATIC in R_mu-nu (R contracted against itself) -- the
       same relationship the (quadratic) Kretschmann scalar R_abcd R^abcd has
       to the Riemann tensor in ordinary GR. Ricci scalar and Kretschmann
       scalar are DIFFERENT invariants of DIFFERENT degree in the curvature:
       related only in that both vanish exactly when the full curvature
       vanishes (gtg_test.cljc's flat-limit check for this one), not
       proportional to each other and not interchangeable in general. This
       namespace does not implement the true linear LDG contraction either --
       doing so correctly requires pinning down, from the LDG geometric-
       algebra convention (not guessed at here), exactly which of R_mu-nu's
       two spacetime indices pairs with which of the curvature bivector's own
       two indices, and there is no independent literature reference value in
       this codebase to test that pairing against -- so it is left as a
       named, explicit follow-up rather than risked as a plausible-looking
       but silently wrong implementation. `curvature-quadratic-invariant` is
       also NOT guaranteed non-negative: `generator-trace-gram`'s K is
       indefinite (+1 rotation-type, -1 boost-type), so a boost-dominated
       curvature can make it negative -- a further symptom, like
       `compact-group-trace-normalization-holds?`'s finding, of this
       generator set's noncompactness.

  PHASE 0d (general-position-gauge reciprocal frame, DELIBERATELY STAGED --
  see the README's Phase 0d section for the two-stage split) adds:
    11. a GENERAL NxN matrix inverse (`kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-det`,
       `mat-minor`, `mat-adjugate`, `mat-inverse` -- ordinary Laplace-
       expansion/adjugate linear algebra, no physics convention involved,
       throws `ex-info` on a ~0 determinant rather than dividing by it, same
       spirit as `kotoba.sm.gauge/diagonal-gram-real`'s guard) and
       `reciprocal-frame`: the GTG reciprocal (dual) frame h-bar^mu of a
       GENERAL invertible position-gauge-field VALUE h (not just
       `position-gauge-identity` or a constant Lorentz matrix, Phase 0b's
       scope), defined by the STANDARD linear-algebra dual-basis
       biorthogonality relation h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu, where '.' here
       is the PLAIN component (Kronecker) pairing sum_a h-bar^mu[a] h_nu[a]
       -- NOT `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`'s Minkowski-metric pairing. Given this
       pairing, biorthogonality is a matrix equation Hbar . H^T = I, so
       Hbar = (H^-1)^T -- `reciprocal-frame` computes exactly this, via
       `mat-inverse` then `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-transpose`; gtg_test.cljc
       checks the biorthogonality relation holds numerically for a concrete
       non-identity invertible h, that h*h^-1=I for that same h, that a
       singular (determinant-0) h throws `ex-info`, and that at
       h = `position-gauge-identity`, h-bar = h EXACTLY (the identity matrix
       is its own inverse and its own transpose).

       *** HONESTY NOTE ***: this is the ORDINARY linear-algebra dual basis
       of the ROWS of h, treating them as an abstract basis of R^4 under the
       PLAIN component pairing -- it is deliberately NOT asserted to be an
       ingredient of the Lasenby-Doran-Gull curvature scalar. A literature
       follow-up (stage 2 of this phase, see `reciprocal-frame`'s own
       docstring and the README's Phase 0d section for the full writeup and
       both source URLs) found TWO independent, mutually-corroborating
       primary sources (Lasenby/Doran/Gull 1998/2004, arXiv gr-qc/0405033;
       Lewis/Doran/Lasenby 1999, arXiv gr-qc/9910039) pinning down the
       ACTUAL Ricci-scalar formula's high-level structure -- and it turns
       out that formula's outer contraction uses the FIXED BACKGROUND
       frame's OWN reciprocal (trivial under the metric, no matrix inverse
       of h needed at all), NOT `reciprocal-frame` (a reciprocal frame OF h)
       as originally guessed. So `reciprocal-frame` is confirmed NOT to be
       what R needs, rather than left merely unconfirmed either way. R
       itself remains unimplemented because a DIFFERENT step -- translating
       the confirmed formula's 'vector . bivector' Clifford-algebra
       contraction into this codebase's six-generator-component array
       representation -- has its own unresolved index/sign risk that this
       pass could not independently verify (see `reciprocal-frame`'s
       docstring for the details). `reciprocal-frame` remains useful in its
       own right as h's standard dual basis (e.g. for a future combined
       covariant derivative, still out of scope), just not as a confirmed
       LDG-R ingredient.

  PHASE 0e (GA-native Minkowski-paired reciprocal frame, PLUS a bounded,
  DECLINED stage-2 curvature-scalar investigation) adds:
    13. `reciprocal-frame-minkowski`: the GA-NATIVE reciprocal (dual) frame
       h-bar^mu_eta of a GENERAL invertible position-gauge-field VALUE `h`,
       defined by the SAME biorthogonality relation `reciprocal-frame` (item
       11) uses, h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu, but THIS TIME with '.' =
       `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`, the Minkowski invariant inner product -- the
       pairing Geometric Algebra / GTG actually use for a reciprocal frame,
       NOT `reciprocal-frame`'s plain component/Kronecker pairing. This is
       exactly the 'Hbar_eta' alternative `reciprocal-frame`'s own HONESTY
       NOTE (item 11) already worked out algebraically (Hbar_eta =
       (H^-1)^T . eta, re-derived and numerically checked independently here
       rather than taken on faith) but stopped short of implementing --
       `reciprocal-frame-minkowski` implements and verifies exactly that.
       VERIFIED (gtg_test.cljc): (a) the Minkowski-paired biorthogonality
       relation holds for a concrete non-identity invertible h, and the
       result is numerically DIFFERENT from `reciprocal-frame`'s
       plain-pairing output for the SAME h (they agree on the timelike
       column and differ in SIGN on every spatial column, exactly as the
       Hbar_eta = Hbar_flat . eta column-scaling derivation predicts). (b)
       at h = `position-gauge-identity`, h-bar_eta = eta EXACTLY
       (bit-for-bit): h-bar^0 = h_0 but h-bar^i = -h_i for the 3 spatial
       rows -- genuinely DIFFERENT from `reciprocal-frame`'s h-bar = h at
       the same point, confirming (not merely restating) the divergence
       `reciprocal-frame`'s HONESTY NOTE predicted without numerically
       checking it. (c) for a CONSTANT Lorentz transformation h = Lambda
       (`kotoba.sm.vector-field`'s existing boost/rotation matrices),
       h-bar_eta = eta . Lambda EXACTLY (up to floating-point roundoff) -- a
       closed form derived from `vf/lorentz?`'s defining property
       Lambda^T eta Lambda = eta (see `reciprocal-frame-minkowski`'s own
       docstring for the derivation), checked for several concrete
       boosts/rotations, not merely argued.
    14. A BOUNDED, DECLINED attempt at independently verifying (via linearized
       weak-field General Relativity, NOT a further literature read of the
       LDG papers, per this phase's task instructions) Phase 0d stage 2's
       still-open question -- the true LDG curvature scalar R. The plan: (i)
       pick a small metric perturbation h_mu-nu(x) with a KNOWN linearized-GR
       Ricci scalar R^(1) = d^mu d^nu h_mu-nu - Box h (a standard textbook
       result, independent of any GTG-paper convention); (ii) build a
       position-gauge field h_mu(x) = delta_mu^nu + (1/2) h_mu^nu(x)
       reproducing it via `derived-metric` to linear order (this step is
       genuinely easy and was worked out: `derived-metric` of that h equals
       eta_mu-nu + h_mu-nu(x) + O(h^2) exactly as expected, since
       `derived-metric`'s h_mu.h_nu bilinear form is already the correct one
       -- no new machinery needed for this step alone); (iii) obtain the
       CORRESPONDING rotation-gauge field Omega_mu(x) from h_mu(x)'s
       derivatives; (iv) run `rotation-field-strength`; (v) test a candidate
       R[mu][nu][k]->scalar formula against R^(1). THIS ATTEMPT STOPPED AT
       STEP (iii): this codebase has NO h_mu(x)->Omega_mu(x) correspondence
       ANYWHERE (grep-confirmed -- consistent with this docstring's own
       'ALSO OUT OF SCOPE' note below, which already says Phase 0a's
       covariant derivative and Phase 0b's derived metric 'are developed
       independently of each other... not yet combined'). Unlike the
       ORDINARY general-relativity vierbein-postulate torsion-free spin
       connection (which relates a curved-spacetime tetrad e^a_mu -- ONE flat
       index a, ONE curved-coordinate index mu -- to Christoffel symbols),
       GTG's h_mu^nu has BOTH indices as components of the SAME flat
       background vector space (h maps a flat gauge-coordinate direction to a
       flat physical-spacetime direction; there is no curved-coordinate side
       to import the ordinary tetrad-postulate formula onto verbatim). The
       genuine GTG-specific 'intrinsic' Omega-from-h relation (part of LDG's
       own gauge-invariance/field-equation construction) is exactly the kind
       of GTG-paper-specific, index/sign-convention-bearing formula this pass
       was told NOT to re-derive from the literature this round, and it
       cannot be safely reconstructed from generic (non-GTG) general-
       relativity textbook knowledge, because ordinary tetrad calculus does
       not carry over to GTG's flat, non-curved-coordinate formalism without
       exactly the kind of paper-specific translation step this codebase's
       own established practice (see `rotation-field-strength`'s and
       `curvature-quadratic-invariant`'s docstrings) already treats as too
       risky to guess at without an independent reference value. So this
       investigation stopped at the SAME CLASS of blocker Phase 0d stage 2
       hit (an unverifiable index/sign convention, no independent numeric
       reference value to test a candidate against), one step EARLIER in the
       pipeline (h->Omega, rather than R->scalar) -- per the task's own
       explicit instruction, this is reported honestly rather than guessed
       at, and `curvature-scalar` remains unimplemented (AS OF Phase 0e --
       Phase 1, item 15 below, resolves exactly this blocker).

  PHASE 1 (field equation Omega(h), the covariant Riemann map, and the true
  LDG Ricci scalar -- ADR-2607102300) adds:
    15. `omega-from-h`: the VACUUM, SPIN-FREE closed-form solution of the
       rotation-gauge field equation, LDG eq (4.53)
       omega(a) = -H(a) + (1/2) a.(d_b^H(b)), with
       H(a) = hbar(grad ^ hbar^-1(a))  (eq 4.49, `H-field`) and
       hbar = `frame-adjoint` of the position-gauge field h (eq 2.46,
       a.f(b)=fbar(a).b -- the SAME adjoint relation used throughout this
       namespace's Phase 0d/0e reciprocal-frame work, applied here to h
       itself rather than to a constant matrix VALUE). Takes an h-FIELD
       (x -> 4x4 matrix, SAME shape as `derived-metric-field`'s h-field
       argument) and a spacetime point x, returns Omega_mu(x) (a 4x6 array,
       the SAME shape `rotation-field-strength` already consumes) --
       THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THIS NAMESPACE Omega_mu IS DERIVED FROM h_mu
       RATHER THAN SUPPLIED INDEPENDENTLY. The closed form was derived from
       LDG eqs (4.42)/(4.46)/(4.48)/(4.49)/(4.53) and cross-derived via an
       independent, standalone Python/numpy+sympy verification script
       (checked into the task's scratchpad, not this repo) that reproduces
       LDG's own closed-form Schwarzschild solution (eq 6.73) to ~1e-13
       (machine/finite-difference-truncation precision) BEFORE any of this
       namespace's Clojure code was written -- see gtg_test.cljc's
       Schwarzschild-solution regression tests for the SAME check ported to
       this codebase's 4x4-matrix/6-component-bivector representation.
       `H-field`, `bivector-commutator`, `wedge-vectors`,
       `vector-dot-bivector`, `bivector->matrix`, `matrix->bivector` are the
       minimal new GA-flavored primitives this required (NOT a general
       from-scratch geometric-algebra engine -- see this function's own
       docstring and the PHASE 1 header comment below for exactly which
       identity each one implements and how each was independently
       numerically cross-checked before being trusted).
    16. `riemann-basis-pair`/`riemann-map-matrix`/`riemann-map`: the
       COVARIANT Riemann map R(a^b), LDG eq (4.48)
       R(a^b) = L_a omega(b) - L_b omega(a) + omega(a)xomega(b) - omega(c(a,b)),
       c(a,b) = a.omega(b) - b.omega(a) (eq 4.46, valid for POSITION-
       INDEPENDENT a,b), L_a = a.hbar(grad) = h(a).grad (eq 4.42, the
       identity a.hbar(grad)=h(a).grad -- L_a is the ordinary directional
       derivative of the omega FIELD along h(a)(x), NOT the flat d_mu of
       Phase 0a's `rotation-gauge-field-gradient`/`rotation-field-strength`
       -- see `riemann-basis-pair`'s own docstring for why these are
       genuinely DIFFERENT connections and reusing Phase 0a's machinery here
       would be WRONG, the exact silent failure mode (identically-zero,
       teleparallel curvature) an earlier investigation hit and diagnosed,
       see the standalone verification script's own header comment).
       `riemann-map`/`riemann-map-matrix` extend R to a genuine LINEAR map
       on the full 6-dimensional bivector space (R is defined on the basis
       bivectors e_mu^e_nu by eq 4.48, and a linear map is fully determined
       by its action on a basis), so `riemann-map` accepts ANY bivector
       argument, including one built from POSITION-DEPENDENT vectors (e.g.
       `wedge-vectors` of two position-gauge-field rows h_mu(x), needed by
       item 17 below) -- not just a fixed-frame basis pair.
    17. `curvature-scalar`: the TRUE Lasenby-Doran-Gull Ricci SCALAR
       R = sum_{a,b} gamma^a.(gamma^b.R(h_b^h_a)) -- the formula Phase 0d
       stage 2 (item 12 above) and Phase 0e (item 14 above) each
       independently confirmed the STRUCTURE of (two independent primary
       literature sources agreeing) but declined to implement, because
       translating 'gamma^b.R(h_b^h_a)' into this codebase's array
       representation needed a bilinear extension of R to GENERAL (not
       basis-pair) bivectors that did not exist yet. Item 16's `riemann-map`
       supplies exactly that missing piece, so this formula is now directly
       transcribable with no remaining index/sign ambiguity: gamma^a =
       `tensor/raise` of the FIXED background basis vector e_a (trivial
       under the metric, confirmed by BOTH literature sources to be the
       correct outer-contraction frame -- NOT `reciprocal-frame`/
       `reciprocal-frame-minkowski`, which are reciprocal frames OF h, a
       DIFFERENT and NOT-needed-here construction, per item 12's finding);
       h_b = h-field(x)[b] = h(e_b) (Phase 0b's existing `h`); R(h_b^h_a) is
       `riemann-map` applied to `wedge-vectors(h_b,h_a)`. VERIFIED
       (gtg_test.cljc): matches 0.0 (LDG's own vacuum Ricci-scalar
       expectation for the Schwarzschild solution -- a vacuum solution of
       Einstein's equation has R_ab=0, hence R=0 as a direct special case)
       to within finite-difference-truncation tolerance at the SAME
       Schwarzschild test points item 15/16 are checked against, and EXACTLY
       0.0 (not merely close) at the flat limit (h=`position-gauge-identity`,
       where every derivative involved vanishes identically, not just
       numerically). This is honestly the FIRST curvature-scalar result in
       this namespace's whole Phase 0a-1 history that Phase 0c, Phase 0d
       stage 2, and Phase 0e's stage-2 investigation each in turn declined
       to reach -- reached here only because item 16 removed the specific,
       previously-unverifiable index/sign step that blocked every prior
       attempt, not by relaxing this namespace's verification discipline.

    PHASE 1 SCOPE NOTE: `omega-from-h`/`curvature-scalar` implement ONLY the
    VACUUM (source-free, T_ab=0), SPIN-FREE (no intrinsic angular-momentum
    matter coupling) closed-form solution (eq 4.53) -- NOT the general GTG
    field equation with a matter/torsion source term, NOT the Einstein
    tensor/multivector G(a) (needed to couple to a general stress-energy
    tensor), NOT the GTG action principle (the Lagrangian this closed form
    is the EULER-LAGRANGE solution of is not derived or checked here), and
    verified against exactly ONE known exact solution (Schwarzschild,
    Painleve-Gullstrand/Newtonian gauge) -- NOT a general proof that this
    namespace's pipeline reproduces GR for arbitrary h. See the EXPLICITLY
    OUT OF SCOPE paragraph below for the full list still deferred.

  EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE, NOT IMPLEMENTED HERE (Phase 0a+0b+0c+0d+0e+1):
  the Einstein tensor/multivector G(a), the GTG action principle, the general
  (matter/torsion-sourced) field equation (only the vacuum/spin-free closed
  form (4.53) is implemented, item 15 above), any proof of equivalence to
  General Relativity for GENERAL h (item 17's `curvature-scalar` is verified
  against exactly one known exact solution, not a general equivalence proof),
  and any dark-matter/dark-energy/de-Sitter extension. ALSO OUT OF SCOPE: a
  general (non-vacuum) combined h_mu+Omega_mu GTG covariant derivative with
  torsion -- Phase 0a's covariant derivative (5) still stands independently
  of the vacuum connection Phase 1 derives (5) was built for a SUPPLIED
  Omega_mu, not the field-equation solution; wiring Phase 1's `omega-from-h`
  into (5) to get a genuine matter-coupled covariant Dirac equation in curved
  spacetime is a legitimate, much larger follow-up, deliberately deferred to
  a later phase. This namespace is a limited, literature-faithful port of the
  rotation-gauge and position-gauge SECTORS, one narrowly-scoped curvature
  invariant, two dual-basis reciprocal-frame constructions (plain-pairing and
  Minkowski-pairing), and the VACUUM/SPIN-FREE field equation with its
  covariant Riemann map and Ricci scalar ONLY, and must not be read as 'GTG
  is fully implemented here' or as any kind of general-purpose gravity
  engine."

  "The reciprocal (dual) frame h-bar^mu of a GENERAL invertible position-gauge
  field VALUE `h` (a 4x4 real matrix, row `mu` = the physical four-vector
  h_mu -- same layout as `position-gauge-identity`/`derived-metric`, see item
  7's docstring), defined by the STANDARD linear-algebra dual-basis
  biorthogonality relation

    h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu

  where '.' here is the PLAIN component (Kronecker) pairing
  sum_a h-bar^mu[a] h_nu[a] -- the ordinary dual-basis construction for ANY
  basis {h_mu} of R^4, independent of any metric and independent of any

  exactly how this differs from, and is NOT verified against, the
  Lasenby-Doran-Gull geometric-algebra reciprocal frame, which uses the
  Minkowski-metric pairing `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot` instead of this plain
  component pairing).

  DERIVATION: write `h` as a 4x4 matrix H (row `mu` = h_mu) and the sought
  reciprocal frame as a 4x4 matrix Hbar (row `mu` = h-bar^mu). The
  biorthogonality condition, component by component, is
  sum_a Hbar[mu][a] * H[nu][a] = delta[mu][nu]; the left side is exactly
  (Hbar . H^T)[mu][nu] (ordinary matrix product), so the condition is the
  matrix equation Hbar . H^T = I, i.e. Hbar = (H^T)^-1 = (H^-1)^T. This
  function computes exactly that: `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-inverse` (throws if
  `h` is singular) then `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-transpose`.

  VERIFICATION (gtg_test.cljc): (a) for a concrete invertible, non-identity
  4x4 matrix, `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-inverse` genuinely satisfies
  h * h^-1 = h^-1 * h = the 4x4 identity. (b) the biorthogonality relation
  h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu (plain component pairing) holds numerically
  for that same non-identity h. (c) at h = `position-gauge-identity`,
  h-bar = h EXACTLY (the identity matrix is its own inverse and its own
  transpose, so Hbar = (I^-1)^T = I^T = I = H -- bit-for-bit, not merely
  close). (d) a singular (determinant ~0) h throws `ex-info` (propagated
  from `mat-inverse`) rather than silently dividing by ~0 or returning a
  garbage matrix.

  HONESTY NOTE, READ BEFORE USING THIS AS 'the LDG reciprocal frame' for a
  general h: *** this function's biorthogonality pairing is the PLAIN
  component/Kronecker pairing, NOT the Minkowski-metric GA scalar product
  `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot` that a GA-native reciprocal frame would generally be
  defined with. *** Working the Minkowski-pairing version through the same
  derivation: sum_a eta[a][a] Hbar[mu][a] H[nu][a] = delta[mu][nu] is the
  matrix equation Hbar . eta . H^T = I, giving Hbar_eta = (H^-1)^T . eta (eta
  is its own inverse in this basis) -- a DIFFERENT matrix from this
  function's Hbar in general, and in particular at h =
  `position-gauge-identity` it gives Hbar_eta = eta = diag(1,-1,-1,-1), i.e.
  h-bar^0 = h_0 but h-bar^i = -h_i for the 3 spatial rows -- NOT h-bar = h.

  *** FOLLOW-UP LITERATURE CHECK (Phase 0d, stage 2 investigation): this
  function's h-of-h reciprocal frame turns out NOT to be what the actual
  Lasenby-Doran-Gull curvature scalar needs at all. *** Reading the primary
  source directly (Lasenby, Doran & Gull, 'Gravity, Gauge Theories and
  Geometric Algebra', Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (1998) 356 487-582,
  updated arXiv version gr-qc/0405033, section 4 'The field equations',
  eqns 4.9, 4.11, 4.12) and a second, independent, mutually-corroborating
  source by two of the same three authors (Lewis, Doran & Lasenby,
  'Quadratic Lagrangians and Topology in Gauge Theory Gravity',
  arXiv gr-qc/9910039, section 2, eqns 5, 6, 12, 14), the Ricci SCALAR is:

    R = sum_{a,b} gamma^a . (gamma^b . R(h_b ^ h_a))

  where h_b = h(gamma_b) (source 1's h_mu, EXACTLY this namespace's Phase 0b
  `h`/`position-gauge-identity` convention -- gr-qc/0405033 eq 3.35's
  g_mu = h^-1(e_mu) is a DIFFERENT, h^-1-built quantity, not this one),
  gamma^a is the reciprocal of the FIXED BACKGROUND orthonormal frame
  gamma_a (TRIVIAL under the Minkowski metric -- gamma^0=gamma_0,
  gamma^i=-gamma_i, i.e. `kotoba.sm.tensor/raise` applied to the ordinary
  basis vectors, NOT a reciprocal frame of h at all), and R(x^y) is the
  BILINEAR extension of Phase 0a's `rotation-field-strength` to an arbitrary
  bivector argument (justified rigorously, not guessed: R_ab is DEFINED as
  D_a Omega_b - D_b Omega_a + Omega_a x Omega_b, manifestly bilinear in a,b
  since Omega(a) is itself linear in a by construction -- so
  R(h_b^h_a) = sum_{rho,sigma} h[b][rho] h[a][sigma] R[rho][sigma] follows
  from `rotation-field-strength`'s own defining bilinearity, needing no new
  literature confirmation).

  Both sources independently agree on this formula's STRUCTURE, and in
  particular BOTH show the outer contraction uses the FIXED frame's OWN
  reciprocal (gamma^a, no inverse of h needed), NOT `reciprocal-frame`
  (h-bar of h) as originally guessed when this function was written -- a
  genuine, literature-grounded correction to that initial assumption.
  HOWEVER, translating 'gamma^b . R(h_b^h_a)' (a vector . bivector -> vector
  Clifford-algebra contraction) into this codebase's R[mu][nu][k]
  six-generator-component array representation (rather than a native GA
  multivector) requires an ADDITIONAL, nontrivial contraction step -- which
  of R's spacetime-index/generator-index slots the contracting vector's
  index pairs with, and with what sign/factor -- that NEITHER source spells
  out in a form directly transcribable to this array representation, and
  that this pass could not independently re-derive with confidence within a
  bounded research effort (a hand re-derivation via the standard GA identity
  v.(a^b)=(v.a)b-(v.b)a produced a candidate formula but with unresolved
  factor-of-2/sign risk once expressed over the SIX generator components
  rather than a full antisymmetric rank-2 slice, and no independent
  numeric-example reference value was found to test a candidate against).
  This is exactly the class of error this codebase's own established
  practice already treats as too risky to guess at without independent
  verification -- see `kotoba.sm.gauge/self-interaction-term`'s
  since-fixed slot-order bug (gtg.cljc's rotation-field-strength docstring)
  and `curvature-quadratic-invariant`'s own honesty note (item 10) for two
  prior instances of the SAME 'which index pairs with which' risk in this
  exact curvature-scalar problem. `curvature-scalar` is therefore
  DELIBERATELY NOT implemented in this namespace -- see the README's Phase
  0d section for the fuller writeup of this investigation, including both
  source URLs. `reciprocal-frame` is offered only as a standard,
  independently-correct dual-basis construction of h's own reciprocal frame
  (useful in its own right, e.g. for a future combined covariant derivative,
  still out of scope -- see the namespace docstring's out-of-scope list),

(defn reciprocal-frame-minkowski
  "The Geometric-Algebra-NATIVE reciprocal (dual) frame h-bar^mu_eta of a
  GENERAL invertible position-gauge field VALUE `h` (same 4x4-matrix layout
  as `reciprocal-frame`/`derived-metric`/`position-gauge-identity` -- row
  `mu` = the physical four-vector h_mu), defined by the biorthogonality
  relation

    h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu

  where THIS TIME '.' is `kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`, the Minkowski INVARIANT
  inner product (eta = diag(1,-1,-1,-1)) -- NOT `reciprocal-frame`'s (Phase
  0d, item 11) plain component/Kronecker pairing. The Minkowski pairing is
  the one Geometric Algebra / GTG actually use for a scalar product (the GA
  scalar product IS the Minkowski-metric contraction), so THIS function --
  not `reciprocal-frame` -- is the one that deserves to be called 'the GTG
  reciprocal frame' of a general h. Given a separate, distinctly-named
  function (not a second arity of `reciprocal-frame`) so both pairings stay
  independently callable/checkable, and `reciprocal-frame`'s existing
  plain-pairing tests keep exercising exactly the function they were written
  against.

  DERIVATION (this is the same derivation `reciprocal-frame`'s own HONESTY
  NOTE already writes out algebraically -- re-derived and numerically
  checked here from scratch, not taken on faith): write `h` as a 4x4 matrix
  H (row `mu` = h_mu) and the sought frame as Hbar (row `mu` = h-bar^mu).
  Component by component, the Minkowski-paired biorthogonality condition is
  sum_a eta[a][a] Hbar[mu][a] H[nu][a] = delta[mu][nu]. Writing eta as the
  diagonal 4x4 matrix `kotoba.sm.tensor/metric`, the left side is exactly
  (Hbar . eta . H^T)[mu][nu] (ordinary matrix product, eta between Hbar and
  H^T because it is eta[a][a] that sits between the two matching index-`a`
  factors), so the condition is the matrix equation Hbar . eta . H^T = I,
  i.e. Hbar = (eta . H^T)^-1 = (H^T)^-1 . eta^-1 = (H^-1)^T . eta (eta is its
  own matrix inverse in this basis, eta . eta = I -- the same fact
  `kotoba.sm.tensor`'s own `raise`/`lower` docstrings already rely on). This
  function computes exactly that: `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-inverse` (throws on
  a ~0 determinant, same guard `reciprocal-frame` uses), then
  `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-transpose`, then right-multiply by
  `kotoba.sm.tensor/metric` via `kotoba.sm.tensor/mat-mat`.

  VERIFICATION (gtg_test.cljc): (a) for `a-non-identity-invertible-h` (the
  same concrete non-identity invertible h `reciprocal-frame`'s own tests
  use), the Minkowski-paired biorthogonality relation
  h-bar^mu . h_nu = delta^mu_nu (`kotoba.sm.tensor/dot`, NOT plain-component
  pairing) holds numerically for every (mu,nu) pair -- and the resulting
  Hbar is numerically DIFFERENT from `reciprocal-frame`'s plain-pairing
  output for the SAME h: concretely, h-bar_eta^0 = [0.5 0 0.5 0] versus
  `reciprocal-frame`'s h-bar^0 = [0.5 0 -0.5 0] -- the two agree on the
  timelike (index-0) column and differ in SIGN on every spatial column,
  exactly as predicted by Hbar_eta = Hbar_flat . eta (right-multiplying by
  the diagonal eta scales column `a` by eta[a][a], i.e. negates the 3
  spatial columns and leaves the timelike column alone). (b) at
  h = `position-gauge-identity`, h-bar_eta = eta EXACTLY (bit-for-bit,
  integer arithmetic throughout, not merely close): h-bar^0 = h_0 =
  [1 0 0 0], but h-bar^i = -h_i for the 3 spatial rows (e.g.
  h-bar^1 = [0 -1 0 0]) -- genuinely DIFFERENT from `reciprocal-frame`'s
  h-bar = h at the very same point, confirming (not merely restating) the
  divergence `reciprocal-frame`'s own HONESTY NOTE predicted without
  numerically checking it. (c) for a CONSTANT Lorentz transformation
  h = Lambda (any of `kotoba.sm.vector-field`'s existing boost/rotation
  matrices), h-bar_eta = eta . Lambda EXACTLY (up to floating-point roundoff
  from `boost`/`rotation-*`'s sqrt/cos/sin) -- a closed form derivable from
  `vf/lorentz?`'s defining property Lambda^T eta Lambda = eta: right-
  multiplying both sides by Lambda^-1 gives Lambda^T eta = eta Lambda^-1, so
  Lambda^-1 = eta Lambda^T eta (eta^-1 = eta), hence
  Hbar_eta = (Lambda^-1)^T . eta = (eta Lambda^T eta)^T . eta =
  eta Lambda eta . eta = eta Lambda (eta symmetric, eta . eta = I) -- i.e.
  row `mu` of Hbar_eta is row `mu` of Lambda scaled by eta[mu][mu] (+1 for
  mu=0, -1 for mu=1,2,3). Checked for several concrete boosts/rotations, not
  merely argued for one.

  HONESTY NOTE: this completes the Minkowski-paired reciprocal frame that
  `reciprocal-frame`'s own docstring derives but stops short of implementing
  -- it does NOT by itself resolve Phase 0d stage 2's open question (see
  `reciprocal-frame`'s docstring's FOLLOW-UP LITERATURE CHECK): the true LDG
  curvature scalar R's outer contraction uses the FIXED background frame's
  OWN reciprocal gamma^a (trivial under the metric, `tensor/raise` of the
  ordinary basis vectors), NOT a reciprocal frame OF h at all -- whether
  Minkowski-paired (this function) or plain-paired (`reciprocal-frame`). See
  the namespace docstring's item 14 for this phase's separate, DECLINED
  attempt to make further progress on R via independent numerical
  verification (linearized weak-field GR), and exactly where that attempt
  stopped (the h_mu(x)->Omega_mu(x) correspondence itself, needed even
  before R's own outer-contraction ambiguity comes into play, is not
  established anywhere in this codebase). This function is offered as h's
  standard GA-native dual basis in its own right (e.g. for a future combined
  covariant derivative, still out of scope), the same status
  `reciprocal-frame` already has for the plain-pairing version -- not
  asserted to be an ingredient of the LDG curvature scalar for a general h."

;;    curl-of-hbar-inverse (inner) and eq (4.48)'s L_a (outer) carry their

  here to a general FIELD VALUE `f` (needed: hbar := frame-adjoint of h)
  rather than only ever appearing inside a reciprocal-frame formula.

  DERIVATION: write `f` as a 4x4 matrix F (row mu = f(e_mu), this namespace's
  STORED convention) and STANDARD-CONVENTION matrix M_f (M_f @ a = f(a) for a
  a column vector) -- since row mu of F is f(e_mu) = column mu of M_f,

  is a^T eta (M_f b) = (M_fbar a)^T eta b for all a,b, i.e. the matrix
  equation eta M_f = M_fbar^T eta, so M_fbar = eta M_f^T eta (eta is its own
  inverse in this basis) = eta @ F @ eta (since M_f^T = F). Converting back
  to STORED form (fbar's row mu = fbar(e_mu) = column mu of M_fbar, i.e.

  SELF-INVERSE (`frame-adjoint` (`frame-adjoint` f) = f, an algebraic

  eta @ eta @ F @ eta @ eta = F (eta@eta=I). This means the SAME function
  both derives hbar from a h-FIELD (Phase 1's actual production use, inside

  *** BUG FIX (found by independent adversarial review, see git history/PR
  description): *** an earlier version of this function computed
  'gamma^a.(gamma^b.R(h_b^h_a))' -- contracting the ALREADY-COVARIANT Riemann
  map `riemann-map`/`riemann-basis-pair` (eq 4.48, which internally uses
  L_a=a.hbar(grad), i.e. is already built FROM h) against a bivector
  `wedge-vectors`(h_b,h_a) built from POSITION-GAUGE-FIELD ROWS instead of the
  FIXED frame basis vectors e_a,e_b. Since `riemann-basis-pair`(a,b) computes
  the LDG-covariant R(e_a^e_b) -- LDG's own eq (4.9), R(B)=R(h(B)) for a FLAT
  R and BASIS bivector B, shows the h-dependence is already baked into HOW
  `riemann-basis-pair` computes its answer, not into WHICH bivector argument
  it is fed -- wedging h_b^h_a on top applied h a SECOND time (this codebase's
  `riemann-basis-pair` corresponds to LDG's calligraphic, already-covariant
  'script-R', which both eq (4.11) and the independent second source, Lewis/
  Doran/Lasenby gr-qc/9910039 eq (12)/(14), contract with FLAT frame vectors
  only, never with h(e_a)/h(e_b)). The bug was NOT caught by this namespace's
  Schwarzschild regression test because that test only checks the SCALAR
  (trace); the erroneous double-h ONLY affects terms whose free index is 0 (in
  LDG's own Schwarzschild solution h(e_1)=e_1, h(e_2)=e_2, h(e_3)=e_3 exactly,
  so double-applying h is a no-op on purely-spatial index pairs), and those
  erroneous ~1e-4-magnitude off-diagonal Ricci-TENSOR terms happen to cancel
  in the trace for this particular solution -- independently confirmed by
  computing the FULL Ricci tensor (not just its trace) both ways: the buggy
  formula gives an ASYMMETRIC tensor (e.g. R_10~1.9e-4 vs R_01~9e-11) while
  this fixed formula gives a properly symmetric, uniformly-~0 (FD-noise-level)
  tensor, as GR's vacuum condition requires (R_ab=0 for ALL a,b, not merely
  its trace).

  Correct formula (this implementation): gamma^a, gamma^b = `tensor/raise` of
  the FIXED background orthonormal basis vectors e_a,e_b (BOTH literature
  sources agree this uses the fixed frame's OWN reciprocal, NOT a reciprocal
  frame OF h -- i.e. NOT `reciprocal-frame`/`reciprocal-frame-minkowski`, a
  DIFFERENT construction `reciprocal-frame`'s own docstring already found does
  NOT belong here). No `wedge-vectors`/general `riemann-map` call needed,
  since both indices here are always fixed basis vectors, never
  position-gauge-field rows -- `riemann-basis-pair` DIRECTLY.

  ARGUMENT-ORDER CAVEAT (read before relying on the SIGN of a nonzero result):
  the code below calls `riemann-basis-pair` h-field x b a (b first, a second),
  chosen to match which gamma contracts FIRST (gamma-b, the inner
  `vector-dot-bivector` call) against which slot of eq (4.11)'s R(e_a^b) --
  re-derived by hand from (4.11)/(4.12)'s structure (Ricci(free-index) =
  sum_{summed-index} gamma^{summed}.R(e_{summed}^e_{free}), the summed index
  occupying R's FIRST slot) and cross-checked for self-consistency against the
  SAME convention this fix's own verification script used to independently
  confirm the Ricci TENSOR vanishes (see below). BUT: because
  `riemann-basis-pair` is antisymmetric (R(a^b)=-R(b^a)), swapping this
  argument order flips the SIGN of the returned scalar -- and the ONLY
  verification available (LDG's Schwarzschild solution) has R=0 identically,
  so it CANNOT empirically distinguish this choice from its negative (a sign
  error would be numerically invisible against a true-zero answer). The
  MAGNITUDE fix above (eliminating the genuine ~1e-4 spurious asymmetric
  Ricci-tensor component) is independently, empirically verified; THIS
  specific sign/argument-order choice is only algebraically justified, not
  independently numerically confirmed -- flagged honestly rather than
  asserted with the same confidence, pending either a literature worked
  example with a NONZERO known curvature-scalar value, or independent expert
  review of the (4.11)/(4.12) argument-order derivation above.

  VERIFIED (gtg_test.cljc): 0.0, within finite-difference-truncation
  tolerance, for LDG's own Schwarzschild vacuum solution (eq 6.79) at
  multiple test points/mass parameters, AND (the strengthened check this fix
  adds) the FULL Ricci TENSOR (not just its trace) is uniformly ~0 at those
  same points, at the FD-noise floor (~1e-10, matching this pipeline's
  documented FD tolerance elsewhere) -- the properly vacuum-consistent result
  the buggy version's scalar-only check could not distinguish from the true
  answer (the buggy version's spurious ~1e-4 asymmetric components were
  ~2000x above this noise floor, not explainable as truncation error).
  EXACTLY 0.0 (not merely close) at the flat limit h=`position-gauge-identity`,
  where every derivative this pipeline computes vanishes identically rather
  than merely numerically.

  This is the first curvature-SCALAR result this namespace's Phase 0a
  through Phase 1 history reaches -- Phase 0c's `curvature-quadratic-
  invariant` is a QUADRATIC, differently-scoped invariant (its own docstring
  has the distinction), and Phase 0d stage 2 / Phase 0e's own stage-2
  investigation each independently declined to implement this exact formula
  for the same, now-resolved, reason. Reached here only because `riemann-map`
  removed that specific blocker, not by relaxing this namespace's
  verification discipline (a Schwarzschild-solution regression test, not a
  bare assertion, backs this function -- see gtg_test.cljc)."
